          'Clean white sand caressing through your feet as you walk across the beach, soaking yourself in the beauty of the place and the sun. Arguably, the best beaches in the world. Take a towel or mat to sit there as there are no benches or shacks to sit. There is a changing room with water facility at a nominal fee. My son and my father drenched themselves in the sea for roughly 3 hours while my wife took a sun bath. I on the other hand walked along the length of the beach enjoying the view and taking pictures. As the sunset approaches the colors in the sky reflect on the sea and make a beautiful symphony which one has to behold in their eyes. Good the the vendors have been kept away from the beach which helps in maintaining the area and also allows space and privacy to people. The eateries offer some good local food esp fish. Tea is made with milk powder which is the trend all across Andaman and may not taste good to many.',

          "It seems difficult to get suitable words for the icon. The cellular jail probably epitomizes the struggle suffered by the Indian freedom fighters (then undivided India). The museums and the corridors, as well as the 'cells', show the prices that they had paid so that we can enjoy our freedom. The visit to the cellular jail was like a pilgrimage a sacred place sanctified by the blood, sweat (and lives) of so many freedom fighters. I feel it is worth visiting the galleries to know about the history and to have a look at the long list of freedom fighters who were put there (mentioned on the walls of the central tower). It was a trip to express my gratitude and homage to the bright young men who lost their youth (and even lives) to set India (then undivided Inia) free. Climbing the floors may be a little difficult for some as the steps are steep. For them, the ground floor cells can offer a good idea - as the cells were almost similar. Watching the light and sound show was an added attraction.",

          'Ross Island or Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep. My experience at the Island was good. Tour to the island is a big challenge for the walkers. To explore the Island visitors should walk. Battery cars are also available for the overview tour. Enjoy wild life with history. Dears are roaming all over but no visitors should feed them because it is an offence and have to pay fine. While exploring enjoy the scream of peacocks. Enjoy coconut water or cold kulfi under the crouching heat. Once you purchase the ticket the countdown begins and the visitors have only one hour. Enjoy.',

          "Took the evening ferry for light and sound show. The process is not well explained as show is government and ferry is private so writing in detail here. Everyday light and sound show happens in evening for which ferry leaves at 4:30 pm If taking the day trip to Ross island won't be able to see the show as the last ferry for day sightseeing is 2:30 pm. First step Book the light and sound ticket online 300 per person .Total seats 180. Off season single show runs in Hindi. In season two shows run in English and Hindi Second step Reach the Aberdeen jetty at 4:00 pm. Third step there will be private ferry operator at the jetty who will issue ferry ticket to toss island only after seeing the online ticket for sound and light show. Otherwise without show ticket you can not take the 4:30 pm ferry. Ferry leaves at 4:30 pm. Reaches in 15 mins. Till 5:45 pm you can explore the island on your own or e vehicles costing 80 / person. On foot is preferable to properly see the ruins. Light and sound show is from 5:45 to 6:30 pm and then the ferry starts back. By 7:00 pm Max you are back at the jetty. Fun outing overall Third step Private jetter",

No tourist is allowed to remain on this island after 15:00 hrs. Actually, no one is allowed to stay on this island beyond designated time. We moved around the island in mini cab on paying ₹80/- per pax. We got snapped ourselves at the highest point on the island. We purchased coconut water @50/- each. We enjoyed the moment.',

          'Go to elephant beach if you want to do water sports. It is small beach and super crowded with all water activities going on. It is reachable by speed boat (20 min ride and 3 hours of stay time) or via trek through forest (track starts closer to Radhanagar beach and is about 40 min track through thick forest. Take a guide if you are trekking) Beach is okay and water activities are pretty costly as compared to places like Goa. One activity I will recommend is Snorkelling to appreciate the corals. Again they charge around 950/- per person (costly as compared to other places) but they also click pictures and videos. It is good activity to look at under water marine life',

          'Taken from the Havelock jetty which really needs to be spruced up and stray dogs to be removed- extremely annoying! The Elephant Beach is better in the morning when we arrived since it gets very busy as the day goes by with batches of tourists arriving constantly. It closes by 3pm so better to go early. We only went in the glass bottom boat which was good but looks like the coral reefs have not recovered much after the 2004 tsunami; so spotted a few live corals not much, mainly white bleached dead corals and some colourful fishes. Have seen better in the Maldives so it was disappointing here. Did not feel like snorkeling since one will see the same. Jetski was very popular amongst the younger crowds and soon a queue built up and they were shorter rides on Jetski later on in the day compared to the morning. Lots of sandy beach area and fruits snacks and drinks available. One can buy the tickets for the beach rides in the jetty as well as in Elephant Beach too.',

          "I would say elephant beach is a must place to visit if you are at Havelock... lot of water sports and activities and crystal clear water and nice beach with calm water. If you have to choose between North Bay in Port Blair and Elephant beach in Havelock, go for Elephant beach as it is much better than North Bay. North Bay doesn't have a beach, water is not so clear and is not so organized as elephant beach. If you are interested in Scuba diving, it is not at Elephant beach, North Bay has it close to the beach itself, but not sure how good it is, and tour operators sell it for 3500 per person, but at North Bay, they were offering diving for as less as Rs 1000. In Havelock, diving is not at Elephant beach but at Nemo beach and cost is 3500 per person for diving near shore, and 5500 for boat diving. To go to elephant beach, you have to reach the jetty (it's costs around 300 one way if your hotel is from beach 2 to 5). From jetty we have to go in a 10 seater speed boat which costs Rs 1000/ person. Complimentary 5 mins snorkeling is free with the boat ticket where you can just see the fishes, if you want to do more and see corals also, it costs 1000 per person and it includes under water photos and video also, but time duration is not much, its around 10-15 mins. Snorkeling tickets can be purchased at the elephant beach itself. For all other activities, like jet ski, banana boat ride, sofa ride etc etc, it is 600 per person and tickets can be purchased at jetty or elephant beach. We did snorkeling here and it is very safe. They give masks which cover full face and we can easily breathe without any water getting inside. We were 3 of us, and we formed a chain and one guide was there on each side and one person was swimming under water before us to take photographs. We saw nice fishes and corals at very short distance from shore. Only thing is time duration is very less, it got over in 10-15 mins. At elephant beach, we are given roughly 2.5 to 3 hours, where we can do activities or spend time on beach. Lockers are available for Rs 100 and hut shaped changing rooms are also there and paid rest rooms and shower rooms but they are not so clean. For food there is a line of hawkers, who sell chat items, drinks and fruit salad. We tried chat, it was good. We had a good time at elephant beach and would recommend it to everyone who visits Havelock.",

No water sports here so no noise and the vendors are also on the road side so ample space and privacy on the beach. One can see many tourists esp foreigners taking sun baths. Just sit here and enjoy nature. Selfies, Groupies, SLR, its a photographers paradise. The mix of various shades of blue, green, white just paint the canvas beautifully.',

Small clean beach , with little water sport activities like para diving , boating etc. Basically this beach has black stone in side the sea shore , which give the name kalapathar beach. This is located on the east side of Swaraj Deep ( Havelock island) , hence this is the place for sunrise. Sunrise here is worth watching when the first rays of sun fall on sea the black stone shines , gives a magical effect. this site is not to be missed, but the only thing is you have to get up very early because sun rise in adman is pretty early.You will find here small shop across the street selling fruits , coconut water , chocolate , biscuits , mineral water an some sea shell handcrafts for gift item.',

          'This Southernmost tip of Port Blair about 25 Kms from the city, is most recommended for Sunset viewing. During evenings, many birds flock to this area, hence the name Chidiya Tapu. The trek to Munda Pahad starts from the Chidiya Tapu beach area. The Sunset Point is 2 Kms before the Chidiya Tapu park. Spend 3- hours to explore this attraction plus 1 hour travelling time from city.',

          'A totally different beach experience when you travel by the side of the sea, through hilly ccurves covered with tropical rainforest. There is a zoo in Chiriya tapu and I will recommend to visit it as you travel through dense forest and then see some rare, endemic bird species and crocodiles and other local animals. Then go forward to Munda pahar beach for which you have to cross a hill and will find a beautiful tidal flat, surrounded by green hills, red with Twilight colour. For the transportation during our whole 7 days trip, we contacted Sadai Tour and Travels (+91 9933202151/ +91 9531918600). They have provided best of service. Mr. Gopal, personally took our requests and arranged comfortable car and very good drivers in reasonable price. He suggested us to visit Chidiya Tapu and it came out as a hidden jem.',

          "Long known to be the best place to watch the sunset in the Andaman Islands, it doesn't disappoint. It's around 30km from the main city and the drive is a bit tiring but it is worth it. The areas surrounding and opposite the beach are beautiful and you're able to get some fantastic photographs.",
